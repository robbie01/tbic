# Trollbox Internet Chat

This is the development branch. If you want something that likely has no bugs, check out the latest release [here](https://github.com/robbie01/tbic/releases/latest).

## What is this?

A trollbox server. Right now it is the bare minimum needed to run a working trollbox server.

## What are you planning on adding?

I'm planning on adding a plugin system for controlling things like spam, admins, channels, PMs, protocol extensions, and more. Stay tuned.

## How will this be different from [Trollbox++](https://github.com/1024x2/tbpp)?

Trollbox++, while semi-modular, isn't quite as modular as I'd like. My intention for TBIC is for it to have a plugin system with support for dynamic loading, unloading, and reloading of modules.
